Project: My spy place  this name should be spy my 

Business Context 

Spies need to connect to claim contracts, receive support from other spies, and share information amongst themselves. Spies need to hide their real identity, but still have a user that other spies can recognize and connect with. 

 
Problem Statement-  

Spies have to do a lot of research or know a lot of people and information to find what they need. The needs of a spy are so specific, they have a difficult time integrating with “civilian” social networks in a way that fulfils the needs they have with regards to their job. We will create a centralized space where spies can network, take jobs and receive support. 
 
This will reduce the time and effort it takes for spies to find specialized information, gadgets, locations, and assistance. 


Scope- 

In Scope: This Webpage will integrate with the existing social media foundation. An ideal environment will be created for spies to connect with each other and find contracts. 

Out of scope for first version: We will not be using geolocation for features on this version. A shop is also out of scope for this version. These features may be expanded upon in future versions. 

Out of scope: Algorithm to automatically suggest potential team members.
